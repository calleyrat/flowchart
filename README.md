R script to edit a flowchart following CONSORT guidelines

# 1. CONSORT GUIDELINES

The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors should use for reporting randomised clinical trials (RCTs). These guidelines are explained by Moher et al. (2010) and are available on https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/

Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, GÃ¸tzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG. CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials. BMJ. 2010 Mar 23;340:c869. doi: 10.1136/bmj.c869. 

There is no one unique way to describe flow diagram of participants in a parallel RCT. CONSORT 2010 guidelines propose to document the following informations : enrolment, allocation, follow-up and analysis.

# 2. GMISC PACKAGE
